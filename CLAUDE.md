# REPuLse

> A Lisp that beats.

Browser-based live coding instrument for algorithmic music. The user writes patterns in
**REPuLse-Lisp** — a small, purpose-built Lisp — and hears them as sound in real time.

Inspired by Strudel.cc and Tidal Cycles, but with a Lisp as the user-facing language
instead of JavaScript, and a ClojureScript pattern engine at the core.

---

## What it is

```
(stack
  (seq :bd :sd :bd :sd)
  (fast 2 (seq :hh :oh))
  (every 4 rev (seq :c3 :eb3 :g3)))
```

That's REPuLse. A REPL in the browser. You type, you hear. No compile step, no build,
no file system. Just patterns and sound.

---

## Architecture

Three layers, strictly separated:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  REPuLse-Lisp  (user-facing language)           │
│  packages/lisp — Reader + Evaluator (CLJS)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Pattern Engine  (pure functions of time)       │
│  packages/core — Pattern algebra (CLJS)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Audio Layer  (sound synthesis + scheduling)    │
│  packages/audio — Rust/WASM                     │
│  app/audio.cljs — JS scheduler + WASM bridge    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Dependency rule:** each layer may only depend on layers below it.
`core` has zero knowledge of `lisp`, audio, or DOM. Ever.

## Core concepts

### Pattern

A **Pattern** is a pure function from a `TimeSpan` to a list of `Event`s.

```clojure
;; TimeSpan
{:start 0N :end 1N}   ; rational numbers — never floats

;; Event
{:value :bd                      ; payload — keyword, number, map
 :whole {:start 0N :end 1N}      ; logical time of the full event
 :part  {:start 0N :end 1N}}     ; active slice (may differ from whole)
```

Time is always **rational arithmetic**. Never floats for time values.

### REPuLse-Lisp

A minimal Lisp. Not general-purpose — a DSL shell around the pattern functions.

| Concept        | Example                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Sequence       | `(seq :bd :sd :bd :sd)`          |
| Stack          | `(stack pat-a pat-b)`            |
| Speed          | `(fast 2 pattern)`               |
| Transformation | `(every 4 rev pattern)`          |
| Anonymous fn   | `(fn [p] (fast 2 p))`            |
| Binding        | `(def kick (seq :bd :bd :sd))`   |
| Mini-notation  | `(~ "bd sd [bd bd] sd")`         |

### Audio bridge

ClojureScript scheduler (setInterval lookahead, ~100ms) queries patterns each cycle
and calls into Rust/WASM for synthesis:

```clojure
(trigger! :bd time duration)   ; schedules one sound event
(stop!)                        ; stops all playback
```

## Technology

| Concern              | Technology                        |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Pattern engine       | ClojureScript                     |
| Lisp interpreter     | ClojureScript                     |
| Audio synthesis      | Rust → WASM (via wasm-pack)       |
| Audio scheduling     | Web Audio API + setInterval (JS)  |
| Browser app          | ClojureScript + CodeMirror 6 + vanilla DOM |
| Build tool (CLJS)    | shadow-cljs                       |
| Build tool (Rust)    | wasm-pack (`--target web`)        |
| Package management   | npm workspaces                    |

---

## Coding conventions

- **Pure functions by default.** Side effects only at the edges: audio output, DOM.
- **Rational time everywhere.** Use `clojure.core` rationals (`1/4`, `3N`) in `core`.
  Never `(/ 1.0 4.0)` for time values.
- **No external CLJS libraries** in `core` or `lisp`. Only `cljs.core` and `cljs.test`.
- **No external Rust audio libraries** in `audio`. Only `web-sys` Web Audio API bindings.
- **Errors surface as typed values at the boundary.** Reader/evaluator internals may throw
  `ex-info`, but `repulse.lisp.core/eval-string` converts failures into a typed
  eval-error result for the app layer.
- **Fuzzy-match typos** in the evaluator. If a symbol is undefined, suggest the closest
  known name.
- **Tests for core.** Every function in `packages/core` has a unit test in `cljs.test`.

## Build

```bash
# First time
npm install
npm run build:wasm       # compiles Rust → WASM

# Development
npm run dev              # shadow-cljs watch app only (no WASM build)
npm run dev:full         # build:wasm + shadow-cljs watch app

# Tests
npm run test             # shared cljs.test runner for core + lisp + app session tests

# Lezer grammar (syntax highlighting) — run after editing repulse-lisp.grammar
npm run gen:grammar      # regenerates parser.js + parser.terms.js
```

### Syntax highlighting + completions checklist

When adding a new built-in name that should be highlighted and autocompleted in the editor:

1. Add the name to `BuiltinName` in `app/src/repulse/lisp-lang/repulse-lisp.grammar`
2. **Run `npm run gen:grammar`** — this overwrites the committed `parser.js`
3. Add a `{ label, type, detail }` entry in `app/src/repulse/lisp-lang/completions.js`
4. Commit both `repulse-lisp.grammar` **and** the regenerated `parser.js`

Skipping step 2 means the grammar change has no effect at runtime.

---

## Dev server

Use `preview_start` to start the dev server before verifying UI changes. The server
runs on port 3000 via `npm run dev` (shadow-cljs watch only — does **not** build WASM).
Use `npm run dev:full` on the first run of a session to build WASM first, then start
the watcher. After code edits, follow the standard `<verification_workflow>` using the
preview tools.

## Phase lifecycle rules (IMPORTANT — follow these every time)

These rules apply in every Claude Code session. They are not optional.

**Branch protection:** `main` is protected. All changes go via Pull Request — never commit directly to `main`.

### Rule 1 — Creating a new phase prompt

When writing a new `PROMPTS/PHASE-*.md` file, **always also**:

1. Add a row to the phase status table above:
   ```
   | XYZ   | Short description                                              | planned      |
   ```
2. Add a `## Phase XYZ — Title 📋 *planned*` section to `ROADMAP.md` with:
   - 2–4 bullet points summarising key additions
   - A `See full spec: [PROMPTS/PHASE-XYZ.md](PROMPTS/PHASE-XYZ.md)` link
3. Commit all three files together.

### Rule 2 — Implementing a phase

When the code for a phase is complete and working, **always also**:

1. Change the phase row in the table above from `planned` to `✓ delivered`.
2. In `ROADMAP.md`, change the heading from `📋 *planned*` to `✅ *delivered*` and
   add a **Delivered:** section listing what was actually built (match the style of
   existing delivered phases in ROADMAP.md).
3. Update `docs/USAGE.md`: add every new built-in, effect, or parameter to the
   relevant reference tables and add at least one usage example.
4. Update `README.md` if the phase adds user-facing syntax or changes the quick-start
   example.
5. Commit all documentation changes in the same commit as (or immediately after) the
   implementation commit.

### Rule 3 — Documentation is part of done

A phase is **not complete** until Rules 2.1–2.5 are satisfied. "The code works" is
necessary but not sufficient. If you finish implementing a phase and realise the docs
haven't been updated, do not mark the task done — update the docs first.

## What REPuLse is not

- Not a general-purpose Lisp. The language exists to describe music patterns.
- Not a DAW. No timeline, no arrangement, no export.
- Not a sample player (yet). Phase 1–3 are synthesis only.
- Not mobile-first. Desktop browser is the target.
